‚öôÔ∏è Core JavaScript Features
Video Management
Smart Autoplay: Uses Intersection Observer to play videos only when they are visible in the viewport.

Performance: Videos are automatically paused when they scroll out of view to conserve system resources.

Error Handling: Includes graceful fallbacks for video elements that fail to load.

Interactive Image Slider
Touch Support: Native swipe gestures for navigation on mobile and tablet devices.

Auto-Advance: Slides automatically transition every 5 seconds.

Navigation: Clickable dots provide a visual indicator of the current slide and allow for direct navigation.

Animations
Scroll-Triggered Effects: Subtle fade-in and slide-up animations are triggered on scroll.

Parallax: A subtle parallax effect is applied to the hero video for added depth.

Smooth Scrolling: Anchor links provide a smooth, animated scrolling experience.

üö® Troubleshooting
Videos Not Playing
File Path: Double-check that the video paths in your HTML are correct and that the files exist in the /vid/ folder.

File Format: Ensure videos are encoded in H.264 MP4 format for the best browser compatibility.

File Size: Very large files (>10MB) may time out. Compress videos for web delivery.

MIME Types: Ensure your server is correctly configured to serve .mp4 files with the video/mp4 MIME type.

Slider Issues
Image Count: Verify that the totalSlides variable in main.js matches the actual number of image slides in index.html.

Console Errors: Check the browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors that could be breaking the slider.

üìä Performance & Deployment
Performance Tips
Video Optimization: Compress all videos to reduce file size without significant quality loss.

Image Compression: Use modern formats like WebP and tools to compress images.

CDN: For production, serve static assets (images, videos, etc.) from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster global delivery.

Production Deployment
Build the project:

Bash

vite build
Upload: Deploy the contents of the generated dist/ folder to your web server or hosting provider.

Test: Thoroughly test all functionality, especially video playback and mobile responsiveness, on the live production environment.
